# Implementation Docs

This folder contains implementation-adjacent notes tied to UI or local code behavior.

Authoritative documentation lives in the root /docs directory.
Do not place architecture, validation rules, or system contracts here.

These notes may change freely as code evolves; contracts change only by explicit review.
